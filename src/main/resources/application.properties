# If we don't define, username is user as a default,
# And password is generated by spring security
# If we want to define a user name and password, we need to add these lines
# spring.security.user.name=test
# spring.security.user.password=test


# If we use a different database, we can add these information
# spring.datasource.url=
# spring.datasource.username=
# spring.datasource.password=
